# Digital Clock ⏱️

### Description

A digital clock project is a fun and educational electronics project for hobbyists and students of all levels. The project involves building a clock that displays the time in a digital format, using a microcontroller such as an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. 

The main components required for the project include an LED display module, a real-time clock (RTC) module, and a microcontroller. The LED display module will display the time in digits, while the RTC module will provide accurate timekeeping and send the time data to the microcontroller. 

The project will require some basic coding skills to write the program for the microcontroller, which will include reading the time data from the RTC module and displaying it on the LED display. The program may also include additional features such as setting the clock, displaying the date, and customizing the display style. 

Overall, building a digital clock project is a great way to learn about electronics, programming, and timekeeping. It can be easily customized and expanded upon, making it a fun and challenging project for anyone interested in electronics or DIY.
